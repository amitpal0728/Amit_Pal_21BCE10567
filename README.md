# Chess-like Turn-Based Strategy Game



## Introduction
This project is a turn-based, chess-like strategy game where two players control teams of characters on a 5x5 grid. Each player commands three types of characters: Pawn, Hero1, and Hero2, each with unique movement rules. The game is implemented with a server-client architecture, using WebSockets for real-time communication and a web-based interface built with React.Made by Amit Pal, 21BCE10567
